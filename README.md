# Simulation-of-Gene-Regulation
The Rangeomorphs are among the earliest organisms known to develop multicellular bodies. Unlike other contemporary life forms (i.e., Ediacaran biota), the Rangeomorphs had a unique self-similar (fractal) body plan that required minimal gene expressions and regulation.
A simplified gene expression and regulation mechanism of it's body plane is simulated in this project. 

Rangeomorphs consist of branching "frond" elements, each a few centimetres long, each of which is itself composed of many smaller branching tubes held up by a semi-rigid organic skeleton.This self-similar structure proceeds over four levels of fractality, and could have been formed using fairly simple developmental patterns.
